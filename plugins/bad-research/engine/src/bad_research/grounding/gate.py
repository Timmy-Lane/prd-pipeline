# STEAL_LIST #4 (OpenAI `【ref†L42-L58】`): bind a claim to a SPECIFIC supporting
# span, not merely "a citation exists." On the keyless path the no-op NLI passes a
# *paraphrased* claim regardless of whether the cited span supports it. The cheap
# lexical pre-filter below bounds the cost of catching that: claim ≈ quote (overlap
# >= CLAIM_QUOTE_OVERLAP_SKIP) → accept on byte-identity, skip the host judge ($0);
# below it (a genuine paraphrase) → route to the batched host-model entailment judge.

# A claim whose token set is >= this fraction contained in the cited span is treated
# as "≈ the quote" — verbatim/near-verbatim. NOTE: this band is NOT covered by Tier-A:
# Tier-A byte-identity checks span-vs-body integrity (the quoted_support still sits at
# [char_start:char_end] with a matching SHA), NOT report-sentence-vs-span fidelity. The
# old residual risk in this band — a >=0.8-overlap report sentence that flipped a number
# or negation ("grew 12%" vs a span saying "grew 21%") — is now closed KEYLESSLY by
# `numeric_or_negation_mismatch` below: such a pair is denied the shortcut and escalated
# to the batched host-model judge (the `[local]`/keyed CrossEncoderNLI lane is still the
# upgrade for the harder semantic-paraphrase cases). On the keyless+host path we accept
# the near-verbatim band ONLY when numbers + negation agree, to bound host-token cost.
