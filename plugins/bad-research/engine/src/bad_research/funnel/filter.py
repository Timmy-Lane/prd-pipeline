"""Stage E — filter junk + redundancy, then STORE survivors to the vault.

1. Plan 05 postfetch_filter: junk/login-wall/paywall/language → drop (returns
   a reason str if junk, None if it passes).
2. Redundancy clustering: pages sharing > redundancy_overlap of their shingled
   content (Jaccard, n=3) are derivative — keep the first (canonical), discount
   the rest (dossier 10 §3.4: "N sources are really 1 source in N outfits").
   Reuses hyperresearch core/similarity.py (shingle/jaccard) verbatim.
3. Store survivors to the vault (disk/SQLite). The raw body lives ON DISK; it
   is what RetrievalEngine.index reads, never what the caller sees.

Returns list[Note] for Stage F — the EXACT type RetrievalEngine.index consumes
(it reads note.meta.{id,title,source,content_type} + note.body + note.path via
chunk_note). The vault seam exposes no load-by-id, so we build each Note inline
from the data already in hand at persist time (note_id from store_note + the
page's body/title/url) — see orchestrator Stage F. This keeps the funnel's
isolation contract (FakeVault stays a pure capture stub) while feeding the
engine real Note objects, not (note_id, body) tuples.
