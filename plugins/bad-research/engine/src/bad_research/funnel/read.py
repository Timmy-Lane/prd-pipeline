"""Stage D — read ONLY the top-K ranked candidates (≤80 ceiling), batched.

The cheap-search -> expensive-read gate pays off here: we fetch the Stage-C
winners and NEVER the full pool. The ~80-read ceiling is load-bearing
(dossier 10 §3.3: reading past it degrades synthesis) and enforced even if a
caller misconfigures read_top_k.

Reads run through fetch_tiered (Plan 04, the Tier 0->3 escalation ladder),
wrapped in funnel._async.acall (the real fetch_tiered is SYNCHRONOUS), bounded
by an asyncio.Semaphore (read_concurrency 10-12 full / 3-5 light).

Chained crawl (browse_page pattern, dossier 10 §2.2): a hub page's outbound
links are ranked by a free JS-cosine score against the query and the top
max_links_per_hub are queued, depth <= max_chain_depth; queued links re-enter
the seen-set so they are never double-read.
