# ── B-5 modality factor (2026-05-27 post-benchmark) ──────────────────────────
# Benchmark bug: q1 ("best tech stack") up-routed to `full` purely because the
# decomposition carried 17 atomic items, then ran the contradiction-graph / loci
# / depth machinery on what is a SURVEY — ~2x the cost on a broad-but-shallow
# curation query. The fix: factor query MODALITY + CONTESTEDNESS alongside the
# atomic-item count so breadth ALONE no longer forces `full`. The genuine
# full-tier triggers (time_periods, argumentative format, contradiction terms,
# multi-domain) are untouched and still escalate regardless of modality.

# Broad-curation modalities. A query whose work is collecting / comparing /
# surveying options does not benefit from adversarial dialectics — it benefits
# from coverage. These modalities can absorb the breadth-only full trigger when
# contestedness is low (mirrors decompose's `light`+`structured` survey class,
# bad-research-1-decompose §7 response_format table).

# when the decompose step did not set an explicit `modality` field). Kept lower-
# case; matched against the joined sub_questions text. Conservative on purpose —
# only escalate-defeating when a clear curation cue is present.
#
# [SEMANTIC-TIERING 2026-05-28] A LEXICALLY-inferred breadth modality (matched
# here, with no explicit `modality` field on the decomp) NO LONGER buys the raised
# survey ceiling. Lexical "best/top/what-are-the" phrasing can't tell "best tech
# *stack*" (enumerate ~17 independent options → shallow/wide) from "best tRPC
# *patterns*" (investigate ~8 facets of ONE subject → deep). detect_modality still
# returns a modality for shape/other uses, but the survey-ceiling down-route now
# gates on `_explicit_breadth_modality` (router.py) — an EXPLICIT `modality` field.

# ── E12 query-SHAPE classifier (2026-05-27) ──────────────────────────────────
# Claude Research classifies the query SHAPE before searching (verbatim
# research_lead_agent.md:12-29): the subagent count AND the delegation pattern
# (sequential vs parallel) are downstream of this 3-way classification, not of a
# raw token budget. Shape is ORTHOGONAL to the cost tier: tier = how many
# resources (light/full), shape = how they're arranged.
#
#   - depth_first   : one topic, multiple perspectives → SEQUENTIAL subagents
#                     (each reads the prior's committed position). "What really
#                     caused the 2008 financial crisis?"
#   - breadth_first : independent sub-questions → PARALLEL subagents, importance-
#                     ordered, K=min(n_independent_subq, cap). "Compare the
#                     economic systems of three Nordic countries."
#   - straightforward : focused/well-defined → a SINGLE subagent. "What is the
#                     current population of Tokyo?"
#
# CRITICAL: query_shape is a NEW field that ADDS the fan-out shape. It MUST NOT
# change classify_route's fast/full decision (the golden corpus's
# decompose-component checks assert that route). The classifier reuses the
# existing modality + contestedness signals; it never feeds back into the route.

# ── E11 user-editable plan-gate (Gemini collaborative_planning; STEAL_LIST #3) ─
# Gemini emits a structured plan → the user approves/edits → execute, so an
# ambiguous/broad query doesn't research the wrong sub-questions. The gate
# (step bad-research-1.6-plan-gate) fires ONLY when the run is INTERACTIVE and not
# `--auto`/wrapped and it is a FULL-ROUTE or BROAD-SURVEY run — route == full OR
# atomic items > ROUTER_LIGHT_MAX_ATOMIC. A non-interactive / wrapped / `--auto` /
# test run NEVER gates (mirrors how 0.5-clarify skips for `--auto`/wrapped) so the
# eval gate + the whole test suite flow straight through. A small bounded `fast`
# run is below the bar — a wrong sub-question there costs less than the approval
# round-trip.
