"""Query router — classify the Step-1 decompose output into a pipeline mode.

Reuses the existing atomic-item analysis (no new classifier). The decision
tree (2-route consolidation; the former agentic-fast + light bands both map to
`fast` now — the split is an internal shape+effort knob, not a route):

  full  if multi-domain, contested, argumentative, time_periods, >=7 items, or a
        pipeline_tier == "full" floor
  fast  else (the bounded planner->writer loop — formerly agentic-fast/light)

[SEMANTIC-TIERING 2026-05-28] Two corrections to the post-B-5 behaviour:

  1. **`pipeline_tier == "full"` from decompose is an honoured FLOOR.** Step 1
     (bad-research-1-decompose.md) judges the SEMANTIC depth the query wants and
     writes `pipeline_tier`, with "Default is full; when uncertain, tier up". The
     router previously IGNORED that field and its docstring falsely claimed it
     "never down-routes a justified full". It now does: an explicit
     `pipeline_tier == "full"` forces `full` — mechanical heuristics may ESCALATE
     above the model's call but never DEMOTE below it. A missing / `"light"`
     pipeline_tier imposes no floor (so every fixture that omits it is unchanged).
  2. **The raised survey ceiling now requires an EXPLICIT breadth `modality`.** A
     merely lexically-inferred survey (detect_modality falling back to
     SURVEY_PHRASE_MARKERS, no explicit `modality` field) no longer buys the
     ROUTER_SURVEY_MAX_ATOMIC ceiling — it falls back to the depth-favouring deep
     ceiling ROUTER_LIGHT_MAX_ATOMIC. This kills the lexical "best X"→light demotion
     of deep single-subject queries while preserving the explicit-survey down-route.
